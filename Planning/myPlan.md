I want my personal website to be a direct reflection of me.

I want, upon entering my site, visitors to know something personal about me, get a sense of my creativity, and catch a glimpse of my humorous/comical side.

I want to incorporate something personal about myself(New York themed).
I want to display my creativity. 
I want to display a glimpse of humor.

I eventually:
 Want to display a portfolio/gallery of other websites I've worked on.
 Want to incorporate creative/complex javascript-driven features into my site.
 Want to make my site interactive.
 Want my site to serve as an 'online resume'
