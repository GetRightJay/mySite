I want the theme of my page to be New York City.

I want my background-image to be New York.

I want the links to my 'About Me', 'Contact', 'My Goals', & 'What I Do' to go with the NY theme.
    ~Maybe marquee signs, street signs, or MTA subway signs.
    
Each page will be unique but still follow the NY theme.

header at the top of each page with links to the other pages

Don't want the site/pages too cluttered

  Want to have a splash screen that would welcome the user at their first visit to my site and then fade away after a second.
