Design
--------
Design the look and feel of your website by producing drawings or other illustrative representations. You may choose to use pencil and paper, whiteboard, digital design tools, etc. If your design documents don't start in digital format, take a picture or otherwise scan them into digital format. Include all design documents in your project repository in a directory called /design.
