I want my personal website to be a direct reflection of who I am as a person/developer.

As soon as visitors are introduced to my homepage I want them to know a little bit about me and catch a glimpse at my creativity.
  As they venture deeper into my site I want them to get more exposure to how creative I can be and then catch a glimpse at my more comical/humorous side.

I want to incorporate/portray NewYork, my creativity, and my comical/humorous side in a professional manner.

I would eventually like to post a portfolio/gallery of some of the other websites 
I've made& have my site serve as an online resume.
